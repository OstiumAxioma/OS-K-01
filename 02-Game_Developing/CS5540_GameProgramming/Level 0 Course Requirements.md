## Final Project
#### FP1: Game Design Document
The first deliverable of the project is effectively a proposal for your game vision. For this purpose, you will need to engage in brainstorming and ideation activities to flesh out your vision for the 3D game you want to develop and to flesh out functional specifications of your game. The goal of this document will be to capture who, what, when, where, and how of gameplay. The document will include sufficient detail to enable readers to get a good conceptual understanding of what your proposed game is about. A template will be made available on Canvas.
#### FP2: Level Design Prototype
In an attempt to encourage you to start working on your game development, this deliverable will require you to submit a prototype of your first level. The goal of this prototype is to start incorporating various game components in your game world. This prototype could involve grayboxing your level and adding a few key interactions (e.g., basic player control). Alternatively, you could incorporate some assets and flesh out the look and feel of your game with actual game assets.
#### FP3: Alpha Game Release
In this deliverable, you will submit the first playable version of your game. As the name implies, this is by no means the final release. The objective of this deliverable is to encourage you to start developing your game early and give you the chance to identify problem areas in your game and improve it in the next deliverable.
#### FP4: Beta Game Release
Building on FP3, you will submit a beta version of your game, addressing the issues identified in the previous deliverable. The beta release will be expected to be more complete than the alpha release with fewer bugs and should feature most of the mechanics of your game. The beta release may be less polished (e.g., UI may not be done yet) than your final game release but should be highly functional.
#### FP5: Gold Master Release
This is the final release of your game, which will be used for final grading. Essentially, this is your “Gold Master” release that would have been sent for master production if this were a real-life game development project. The game must be highly polished. You will also submit a project report, along with your updated game design document.
#### FP6: Game Demo
For project presentations, you will prepare a trailer for your game and submit a video demo. You will also watch and comment on other teams’ game demos.
#### P7: Peer Evaluations
The last deliverable of the project involves you providing peer evaluations of your teammates’ contribution to the project. A survey link will be sent out after the projects have been submitted.

### TARGET
- [ ] Show that you did your best to produce the best game your team can.
- [ ] Be a highly polished 3D video game.
- [ ] Feature high interactivity and appropriate visual and audio effects.
- [ ] Use at last three different animations for visual effects.
- [ ] Be highly polished and never use primitive shapes or default Unity skybox (solid blue) as the only assets.
- [ ] Have a clear story and should support progression.
- [ ] Have at least three levels with various game mechanics in each level. Each level should feature at least one new mechanic/loot/particle effect/interaction technique/etc.
- [ ] Have an intuitive user interface that displays progress/time/health/damage/etc.
- [ ] Use a game manager that keeps track of time/level/health/ammo/etc.
- [ ] Implement game AI and use intelligent behaviors for enemies and NPCs.
- [ ] Have a main menu that allows the players to start the game and keep track of their progress. The main menu could, for instance, display the amount of time the player has spent playing the game. The main menu should also include a section that displays information about your team (game programmers). Player
